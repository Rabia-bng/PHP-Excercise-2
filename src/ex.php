        <h2>About This Website</h2>
        At Golden Crumb Patisserie, we believe life is too short for bad pastries or for saying no to good
                    ones. Every treat we bake is golden, flaky, and made with real butter (because compromises don’t
                    belong in desserts).
                    We handcraft each pastry with care, but let’s be honest they’re meant to be devoured, not admired.
                    From buttery croissants to indulgent desserts, our goal is simple: make your cravings impossible to
                    ignore.
                    Come for the smell, stay for the crumbs, and leave knowing you made the right choice.</p>
